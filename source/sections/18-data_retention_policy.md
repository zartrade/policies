# 18. Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Shape Software understands and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor, and at times a business associate, Shape Software is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, Shape Software has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for Shape Software Customers to support data retention laws.

## 18.1 State Medical Record Laws
